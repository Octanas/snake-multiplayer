# Python Snake Multiplayer

The objective for this project is to modify an [already existing Snake game code in Python](https://gist.github.com/sanchitgangwar/2158088) so it supports multiplayer, using mechanics from both the Snake game and the Tron Cycle game.

## Getting Started (for Windows)

[Download the *curses* package](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses) relative to the version of Python you're using and install it with the following command (in the directory to where you downloaded it to):

`python -m pip install curses-[curses_version]-cp##-win32/64.whl`
